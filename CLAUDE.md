# CLAUDE.md — OG_Recon operating memory

Auto-loaded every Claude Code session. Read before touching the engine.

## What this is

A deterministic, "on-rails" **forward-only** reconciliation engine for
University of Tennessee (UT) bank accounts in Oracle Cash Management (DASH):
match open bank statement lines (BSL) to open system transactions (ST) →
**Match / Candidate / Review**. The pool draws on every available source —
ST, Receivables receipts, and the MET/ORT chain.

The **backward** engine (re-audit reconciled groups → recommend unwinds) was
split into the separate **Unreconcile2** repo for speed. An `*All_Data*`
workbook is recognized here but never loaded — do not reintroduce it.

The binding behavioral contract is **`UT_Recon_Engine_BUILD_SPEC.md`**. When code
and spec disagree, the spec wins — fix the code.

## Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `recon_engine.py` | Self-contained forward engine + CLI. Primitives (§7), router (§4), binder (§5), pool (§8), forward P0–P10 (§9), writer (§13), `run()` + JSON run log (§15). Backward (§10) lives in Unreconcile2. |
| `recon_audit.py` | Independent audit (§14). **Imports nothing** from the engine — keep it that way. Re-parses raw sources with its own binder; enforces C1–C10; gates delivery. |
| `run_recon.py` | Per-run (per-upload) wrapper. Stages one upload into an immutable `runs/<run_id>/` folder (strips 8-hex upload prefixes; keeps plausible `YYYYMMDD` date prefixes), pre-flights routing (fails loud on no-BSL / any mixed-account token / case-insensitive staged-name collisions, and removes the failed folder so the run-id stays free), writes a SHA-256 provenance `manifest.json`, then calls `recon_engine.run`. Exit 0 = audit PASS; 2 = audit FAIL (outputs quarantined — written for forensics, not approved for delivery); 1 = unusable upload. |
| `test_recon.py` | Unit + synthetic end-to-end tests (engine and per-run wrapper). |
| `UT_Recon_Engine_BUILD_SPEC.md` | The spec. Binding. |

## Run / test

```bash
python3 run_recon.py <upload_dir_or_files>          # one upload = one run folder
python3 recon_engine.py <input_dir> -o ./outputs    # direct engine invocation
python3 -m unittest test_recon -v                   # 56 tests
```

## Non-negotiable doctrine (do not "improve" these away)

1. **Integer cents only.** Money is `cents()` → signed int. **Never** float
   math, never rounding/tolerance/fuzzy matching. Exact signed-cent equality.
2. **No pandas.** It float-coerces zero-padded refs and merchant IDs. Stdlib +
   `openpyxl` + `decimal` only.
3. **Fail loud.** Unresolved required file/column/relationship → raise
   `InvalidSourceData` / `MissingRequiredFile` / `AmbiguousColumn` naming the
   file, role, and candidates. Never guess a column; never silently drop a row.
4. **Amount alone never makes a Match.** Requires exact amount **and**
   corroboration (reference tie, or payer tie for named-payer rules). Date
   supports, never suffices.
5. **Conservation.** Each BSL appears exactly once across the three tabs; each
   ST is consumed at most once across Matches + Candidates (shared `Ledger`).
   Both asserted at end of `forward_reconcile`.
6. **Fixed pipeline.** A later pass never overrides an earlier one. Availability
   is re-derived inside every loop (`ledger.is_available`), never precomputed.
7. **Guardrails:** Journal-source STs never match bank lines. A MID receipt
   reconciles only through the merchant lane. Sibling references (equal-length
   numerics differing in the last 1–2 digits) are **conflicts**, never ties.
8. **Dedup before summing.** Keep-largest applies only to the
   total-plus-splits signature (largest == sum(rest), signed cents); borrow
   counterparty from a dropped split. Same-key rows that don't sum that way
   are distinct receipts sharing a label — ALL kept, ids disambiguated
   `<id> [<amount>]` with `base_id` preserving the MET bridge join. Engine
   and audit dedup independently.
8b. **Payer contradiction (owner, 2026-07-11).** Zero-corroboration
   (amount-only) pairings are barred — even as Candidates — when both sides
   carry payer tokens and share none ("City of Chattanooga has nothing to do
   with Israel"). Reference ties outrank payer text; silence never
   contradicts.
9. **Determinism.** No randomness, no clock. `Date.now`/serials excepted where
   parsing Excel. Sort candidate sets by (amount, date, id) before choosing.

## Conventions

- `datetime` is checked **before** `date` (`datetime` subclasses `date`).
- Falsy-zero guard: test `is not None`, never truthiness (0 cents is valid).
- **Position never binds.** Columns bind by content-first scoring over all
  columns; content samples the first 50 NON-BLANK values per column across
  the whole sheet (sparse columns score on what they carry); the header row
  is located, never assumed row 0; optional roles stay unbound on zero
  evidence or a blind tie — except verbatim-duplicate columns (bind leftmost)
  and signed/unsigned amount twins (bind the signed one); newest-file ties,
  ambiguous sheet substring matches, and MID-master GL conflicts fail loud. The audit re-binds
  with the same alias vocabulary (duplicated literals — still imports nothing
  from the engine). Column rearrangement is pinned identical-output by
  `TestColumnRobustness`.
- Output cells starting with `=` get a leading space (no formula injection);
  workbooks are **static values only**, zero formula cells.
- Output format is locked by §13: Carlito 11pt, navy `FF1F4E78` header,
  freeze `A4`, 9 fixed columns, no provenance rows. The audit's C9/C10 will
  fail you if you drift. (The dark-red forensic/unwind book is Unreconcile2's.)

## Working rules

- Any change to matching logic must keep `python3 -m unittest test_recon` green
  and the synthetic end-to-end audit at `status: PASS`.
- **Real-data validated (2026-07-10, FHB Master UNR exports):** router,
  binder, MET scope join (all-accounts export filtered by long→short bank
  name), MET↔ST 1:1 bridge (13,715/13,863 bridged; never duplicated), native
  `DEPOSIT_ID`/`RECEIPT_ID` columns preferred over `d:/r:` description parse,
  ORT deposit-group pass (P4 phase 2), NA-placeholder nulling, integer
  reference cells (an int is a reference, not an Excel date serial), `.xlsb`
  via pyxlsb. Real exports are NOT committed; `TestRealDataShapes` pins their
  shapes synthetically. The relationship docs
  (`UT_Recon_ORT_Data_Relationships.md`, SPN companion) are the domain
  authority for joins/gates alongside the spec.
- UNR-only exports are residuals: Oracle already took the easy matches, so
  low Match counts with precise Candidate/Review causes are CORRECT there,
  not a defect. Receipts/Edison/GMS exports enrich what can match.
